Take the Leetcode building tutorial from Harkirat Singh and integrate with something like [AnkiDroid](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)[Anki - powerful, intelligent flashcards](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), basically where u can keep ur questions and then come back later and see the solutions as well as code it up and test it.

Make Vercel project by the good approach.

|  | ‚ôüÔ∏è CHESS ‚ôüÔ∏è |
| :----: | :---: |
| 01 | Build a multiplayer chess game like https://chess.com |
| 02 | Frontend should allow users to signup, create accounts and create a room |
| 03 | On room creation, they can share the link with their friend who can join the group as well
| 04 | Add move validation to make sure users can only make valid moves
| 05 | Use either canvas or raw HTML blocks for the game. You may also use a game engine like phaser. |
| 06 | You will need to do socket programming since this is a real-time game. |

|  | üê§ MULTIPLAYER FLAPPY BIRD GAME üê§ |
| :----: | :---: |
| 01 | Create a multiplayer flappy bird game where users can invite their friends and play against each other like [this project.](https://github.com/ourcade/flappy-bird-hathora)|
| 02 | Use raw canvas for rendering, and write all physics yourself (Basic physics like acc, velocity ...) |
| 03 | You will need to do socket programming since this is a real-time game. Sockets would relay the positions of users to each other. |

|  | ü§ñ CREATE A UI ON TOP OF CHAT-GPT API ü§ñ |
| :----: | :---: |
| 01 | Create a ChatGPT clone using their APIs |
| 02 | Use their APIs on the backend, relay the information to your frontend |
| 03 | Make sure your frontend experience is 10x better than the native chat GPT experience. |
| 04 | Allow users to put in their own Chat GPT API keys and use GPT 4. |

|  | CREATE A LOW LATENCY TRADING SYSTEM IN RUST |
| :----: | :---: |
| 01 | Create a WebSocket server in rust |
| 02 | Send data that looks similar to trading applications (create order, cancel order) |
| 03 | Compress data as much as you can. Read about pbfs |
| 04 | Regionally distribute this trading application and send trades closer to the main server |
